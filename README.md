Quantum Computing simulator in Python.

Full featured, simple to use, flexible.
Allows user-defined quantum gates, user-defined basis for measurements.
Easy to follow documentation with tutorial introduction. See qclib/qclib-doc.txt.
Example implementations of popular quantum algorithms.

Code for [automated] regression tests also serves as examples to quickly learn qclib.
